# Sales Forecasting for Retail Chains

This project involves the analysis and prediction of weekly sales data for a retail store chain. The dataset includes information about store features, sales, and store types. The project follows a structured approach, including data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning modeling.

**Key Steps:**

**_Data Exploration:_** The project starts with data exploration to understand the structure and features of the datasets. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques such as summary statistics, correlation analysis, and visualization are used to gain insights into the data.

**_Data Preprocessing:_** Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering. Techniques like label encoding, handling outliers, and transforming date variables are applied to prepare the data for modeling.

**_Machine Learning Modeling:_** Several regression models, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor, are trained on the preprocessed data to predict weekly sales. The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as R^2 score and Mean Squared Error (MSE). The best-performing model, Random Forest Regressor, is serialized and saved for future use.

**Conclusion:**

The project concludes with a summary of the machine learning process and the selection of the best model for predicting weekly sales. The serialized model can be deployed for making predictions on new data or integrated into a production environment for decision-making purposes.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques to solve real-world business problems, such as sales forecasting for retail stores.
